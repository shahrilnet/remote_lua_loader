## Remote Lua Loader

Remote lua loader for PS4 and PS5, based on gezine's [finding](https://github.com/Gezine/ArtemisLuaLoader/) that allows games built with Artemis engine to load arbitrary lua file. This loader is not firmware dependant, and has been successfully tested on PS5 Pro 10.40.  

Currently this loader is specific for the following list of games:

1. Raspberry Cube (CUSA16074)
2. Aibeya (CUSA17068)
3. Hamidashi Creative (CUSA27389)
4. Hamidashi Creative Demo (CUSA27390) - Requires latest firmware to download from PSN
5. Aikagi Kimi to Issho ni Pack (CUSA16229)

For guide on how to setup this loader, please refer [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)

This repo provides few [payloads](payloads/) for you to play around. PRs for useful payloads are welcomed
